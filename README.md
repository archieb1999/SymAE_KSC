# SymAE_KSC
This jupyter notebook has the neural network architectures used in this
study written in julia programming language. The SymAE network used for
KSC scene is there somewhere in the middle section, and the feed-forward
dense layer network used for classification is present at the end of the
notebook.

All the datasets and train-test pixel distribution are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h5CjduUFRIdh0igo3_h5U7lqia1sOFUc?usp=sharing
